- *[David Melo](https://github.com/Davidmelo9133)*
- *[Juan Andr√©s Ruiz](https://github.com/JuanRuizIng/)*

## Overview ‚ú®

In this case we decided to use a dataset that includes information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017. **[The dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)** has 181.691 rows and 135 columns: we subjected it to loading, cleaning and transformation processes to find interesting insights about the different terrorist attacks recorded there.

***The tools used are:***

* Python 3.12 ‚ûú [Download site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Jupyter Notebook ‚ûú [VS Code tool for using notebooks](https://youtu.be/ZYat1is07VI?si=BMHUgk7XrJQksTkt)
* PostgreSQL ‚ûú [Download site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* Power BI (Desktop version) ‚ûú [Download site](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop)

The libraries needed for Python are

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SQLAlchemy
* Dotenv

These libraries are included in the Poetry project config file (*pyproject.toml*). The step-by-step installation will be described later.

## Dataset Information <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa5298c-e359-4ef1-976d-b6132e8bda9a" alt="Dataset" width="30px"/>

> [!NOTE]
> This information is based on [the following file](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf).

After a rigorous cleaning and transformation process, our dataset has the following columns arranged for the analysis and visualization of your data:

* **eventid**: ID of the event in the GTD. It's a 12-digit number indicating the date of the incident (first 8 digits) and a sequential case number (last 4 digits).
* **iyear**: Year of the incident.
* **imonth**: Month of the incident.
* **iday**: Day of the incident.
* **extended**: Indicates if the duration of an incident extended more than 24 hours. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **country_txt**: Name of the country where the incident occurred.
* **country**: Country code where the incident occurred.
* **region_txt**: Name of the region where the incident occurred.
* **region**: Region code where the incident occurred.
* **city**: City where the incident occurred.
* **latitude**: Geographic latitude of the incident.
* **longitude**: Geographic longitude of the incident.
* **vicinity**: Indicates if the incident occurred in the vicinity of a city or locality. Values: `1` for "Yes, nearby", `0` for "No, at the exact location", `9` for "Unknown".
* **crit1, crit2, crit3**: Criteria for inclusion in the database, evaluating if the incident meets certain terrorism standards. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **doubtterr**: Indicates if there are doubts about whether the incident is an act of terrorism. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No (Essentially, there is no doubt that it is a terrorist act)".
* **multiple**: Indicates if the incident is part of multiple related incidents. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **success**: Indicates if the terrorist attack was successful. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **suicide**: Indicates if the attack was a suicide attack. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **attacktype1_txt**: Textual description of the type of attack.
* **attacktype1**: Code of the type of attack.
* **targtype1_txt**: Textual description of the type of target.
* **targtype1**: Code of the type of target.
* **natlty1_txt**: Textual description of the nationality of the target.
* **natlty1**: Code of the nationality of the target.
* **gname**: Name of the group that carried out the attack.
* **guncertain1**: Indicates if the perpetrator group is suspected or unconfirmed. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **individual**: Indicates if the perpetrators were individuals not affiliated with a group. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **nperps**: Number of perpetrators.
* **nperpcap**: Number of captured perpetrators.
* **claimed**: Indicates if someone claimed responsibility for the attack. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No".
* **weaptype1_txt**: Textual description of the type of weapon.
* **weaptype1**: Code of the type of weapon.
* **nkill**: Number of people killed.
* **property**: Indicates if there was property damage. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No", `9` for "Unknown".
* **propextent_txt**: Textual description of the extent of the damage to the property.
* **propextent**: Code of the extent of the damage to the property.
* **ishostkid**: Indicates if there was a hostage kidnapping. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No", `9` for "Unknown".
* **INT_ANY**: Indicates international participation. Values: `1` for "Yes", `0` for "No", `9` for "Unknown".

## Run the project <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99bffef1-2692-4cb8-ba13-d6c8c987c6dd" alt="Running code" width="30px"/>

### Clone the repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although in this case the example is done with Ubuntu using WSL, this process can be done for any operating system (OS).

Execute the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JuanRuizIng/GlobalTerrorismAnalysis_ETL.git
```

### Download the dataset

Given the large size of the file to be analyzed, we recommend downloading the dataset on your own at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd). Once downloaded, create a folder called data in the cloned repository: inside it save the CSV file.

#### Demonstration of the process

![CSV file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6da9726-8423-46c9-a146-cd2a1db33dc9)

### Enviromental variables

> From now on, the steps will be done in VS Code.

To establish the connection to the database, we use a module called *connection.py*. In this Python script we call a file where our environment variables are stored, this is how we will create this file:

1. We create a directory named ***env*** inside our cloned repository.

2. There we create a file called ***.env***.

3. In that file we declare 6 enviromental variables. Remember that the variables in this case go without double quotes, i.e. the string notation (`"`):
   ```python
      PG_HOST = # host address, e.g. localhost or 127.0.0.1
      PG_PORT = # PostgreSQL port, e.g. 5432

      PG_USER = # your PostgreSQL user
      PG_PASSWORD = # your user password
      
      PG_DATABASE = # your database name, e.g. postgres
   ```

#### Demonstration of the process

![ENV file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed5d86b4-aab7-4085-adb2-ff790ad2b35b)

### Installing the dependencies with *Poetry*

> To install Poetry follow [this link](https://elcuaderno.notion.site/Poetry-8f7b23a0f9f340318bbba4ef36023d60?pvs=4).

Execute `poetry install` to install the dependencies. In some case of error with the *.lock* file, just execute `poetry lock` to fix it. Now you can execute the notebooks!

#### Demonstration of the process

![Poetry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68ff3ad-d3d7-4d4a-bd41-22550b1daa4b)

### Running the notebooks

We execute the 2 notebooks following the next order. You can run these by just pressing the "Execute All" button:

   1. *001_rawDataLoad.ipynb*
   2. *002_GlobalTerrorismEDA_Load.ipynb*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed210736-f1ce-4ef3-a5b5-d8777202e132)

Remember to choose **the right Python kernel** at the time of running the notebook.

### Connecting the database with Power BI

1. Open Power BI Desktop and create a new dashboard. Select the *Get data* option - be sure you choose the "PostgreSQL Database" option.

![Power Bi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a822ae-5a74-49c8-abf2-2a242c23ab96)

2. Insert the PostgreSQL Server and Database Name. For example, *localhost* and *postgres*, respectively.

3. If you manage to connect to the database the following tables will appear:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/949f2a7e-51c8-4c68-921d-b5fa37b3c663)


4. Choose the *global_terrorism_db_cleaned* table and start making your own visualizations!
