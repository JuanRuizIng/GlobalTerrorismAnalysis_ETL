2. Click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
3. If you havenâ€™t configured the OAuth consent screen yet, you will be prompted to do so:
   
    - Click on **Configure consent screen**.
    - Select **External** as the user type and click **Create**.
    - Fill in the basic information (application name, email address, etc.), then click **Save and Continue** until the configuration is complete.

### 4. Download the `client_secrets.json` File

1. After creating the OAuth client ID, you will see an option to **Download** the credentials file.
2. Download the `client_secrets.json` file and save it to your project directory.

### 5. Install the `PyDrive2` Library (Optional)

If you're working with Python to interact with Google Drive, you can use the `PyDrive2` library:

```bash
pip install PyDrive2

```

### 6. Using the `client_secrets.json` File

The `client_secrets.json` file is necessary to authenticate your application with Google Drive using OAuth 2.0. This file should be used when configuring your application's authentication flow.

### 7. Run Your Application

Depending on the library you're using, configure your application to load the `client_secrets.json` file and follow the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you do not share the `client_secrets.json` file publicly, as it contains sensitive information for your Google API authentication.
- Keep this file in a secure directory and exclude it from any public repository by adding it to the `.gitignore` file if necessary.
